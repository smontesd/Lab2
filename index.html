                <h2>April 7, 2021</h2>
                <h3>Wednesday</h3>
                <p>Today has been good to me. I attended LISL 1C (<i>American Sign Language Conversation</i>) in the morning, and
                    once class ended I kind of procrastinated for a bit on my lab for CSE 110.
                    I spent a fair amount of time today studying the flags of all the countries around the world.
                    I took a test to see if I could name all 197 countries by their flags and I got 183 out of 197.
                    I then compiled a list of my 10 most favorite flags of the world. I also attended lecture for CSE 130 (<i>Programming Languages: Principles & Paradigms</i>).
                    CSE 130 is actually rather enjoyable; however, I do not entirely see how I can apply what I am learning in CSE 130 with my other CSE courses.
                    As I finish today's blog post I still have a lot of time to my day, I may spend the rest of it playing <i>Rocket League</i> as a new season came out today and I'm very excited.

                <h3>Tuesday</h3>

                <p>Today I had a lot of fun. I started the day with LISL 1CX (<i>American Sign Language Analysis</i>)
                    and I was able to complete my readings for the class rather early.
                    I also played the drums for a bit, and listened to reggaeton which has a very simple drum pattern.
                    I have a drum kit that looks similar to the one shown in the video above. I also included an audio file of the main drum pattern of the reggaeton genre below.
                    I played chess for an hour or two and then attended lecture for CSE 110 (<i>Software Engineering</i>).
                    Afterwards I played <i>Rocket League</i> for a bit then asked my friend, Jesus, if he wanted to get Boba.
                    I got a Milk Tea Boba which has milk, half and half, and black tea. I always order Thai tea boba so I figured I should switch things up today.
                    We got pretty hungry so we went to go get chicken wings.

                <p>
                    I had a lot of time to relax today. I finished all my work for the day around 2pm.
                    This quarter has been <em>very good</em> to me. Last quarter I would have to do lectures and homework and I would finish my days like at 7pm.
                    Today I was looking for apartment listings in Seattle for my upcoming internship this summer.
                    My internship is going to be remote; however, I wanted to visit the city in case I am given a return offer.
                    <br>
                    Originally me and my friend Darin were going to try to find a two bedroom apartment in Seattle, but we may have to live in seperate studios.
                    Its almost <em>impossible</em> to find a place <strong>3 month lease</strong> for a funished two bedroom apartment in Seattle.
                    First there are not that many listings for two bedroom apartments that are furnished, but to top it off most leases for the summer are not short term.
                    I know i'll find a place soon. Until then i'll be getting ready to see the city!
